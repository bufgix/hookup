On the configuration panel, you'll see that some fake pages have been already set up. Select the one for your use. "Current Page" part contains the data that victim will see.

### Results

The ngrok URL publishes your local server to the internet. You can get your fake page's URL at the top right corner of the screen(the part which says "Ngrok Url: ".). If your victim types their credientals correctly and pushes the send button, you'll handle the POST payload and results will be shown like the image above.
